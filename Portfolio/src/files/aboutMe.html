						<div class="aboutMeText">Welcome to my world. My name is Priten Vora, and my goal in life is to make really cool stuff that makes people happy. I am a student, programmer, photographer, and aspiring video game designer. Game programming combines technical knowledge and proficiency with creativity, teamwork, and communication, and I firmly believe that if crafted well, gaming can be the most effective platform in humankind's history for engaging, inspiring, and entertaining people. By being a computer science student, I'm working toward my goal of being a game programmer, but I also enjoy programming in general, so I often take on programming projects outside of the scope of video game creation. You will find many such projects in my programming section.</div>
